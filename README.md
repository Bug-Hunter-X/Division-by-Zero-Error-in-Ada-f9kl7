# Ada Division by Zero Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero. The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in a runtime exception.  The solution file `bugSolution.ada` shows how to handle potential division by zero using conditional statements.

## Running the Code

You will need an Ada compiler (like GNAT) installed to compile and run the example code.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the Ada files:  `gnatmake bug.ada` (or similar command based on your compiler)
3. Run the executable.

You'll observe that the original code raises an exception.  The solution code avoids the exception.
